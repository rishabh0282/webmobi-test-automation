# Playwright QA Automation Suite

This repository contains automated end‑to‑end tests built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to validate event flows in a web application.  
It covers authentication, session management, and event creation, with GitHub Actions integration for continuous testing.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Authentication tests**: Valid login, logout, and wrong password scenarios
- **Event flow tests**: Create new events and verify persistence in the events list
- **Session management**: Ensure protected routes are inaccessible without login
- **CI ready**: Minimal GitHub Action workflow to run tests on every push/PR

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `utils/helpers.js` → reusable login, logout, and event creation helpers
- `tests/` → Playwright test cases (happy path, session management, wrong password)
- `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` → GitHub Action workflow for CI

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Run Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
